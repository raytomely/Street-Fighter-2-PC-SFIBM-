SFIBM is the first editable fighting game on PC that spawned a lot
of street fighter hacks and other crossovers in the 90's, it has also inspired the M.U.G.E.N creators and other fighting game engines like Truefenix's SFR and UFGE engines.

I have found the source code for SFIBM which dates from 1991 in an old Korean archive site, and it immediately dawned to me to port it. and I did it with the cross-platform library SDL so that it can be easily ported to other platforms.
